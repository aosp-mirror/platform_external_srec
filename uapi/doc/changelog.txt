Bugfixes
--------

- Maintaining classpath in C++ JNI code
- Recognizer was leaking memory on successful recognition
- Recursive mutexes are broken on the Q platform. We've implemented a workaround.
- Singleton creation was not thread-safe
- Q platform does not support native methods on Java nested classes. We've implemented a workaround.
- NBestRecognitionResult.getEntry() crashes if index == NBestRecognitionResult.getSize()
- Deleting components from inside callbacks caused a crash
- Recognizer was leaking memory if a recognition result was returned before end-of-speech
- Grammar::UnloadTask was invoking onLoad() instead of onUnload()
- We no longer attach() and detach() native threads to the JVM every time an event is fired

Beta 2 Logging
--------------

	Disabling UAPI logging
	----------------------

	Logger logger = Logger.getInstance();
	logger.setLoggingLevel(LoggingLevel.LEVEL_NONE);


	Enabling UAPI logging
	---------------------

	Logger logger = Logger.getInstance();
	logger.setLoggingLevel(LoggingLevel.LEVEL_TRACE);


	SREC Logging
	------------

	One can define SREC_ENGINE_VERBOSE_LOGGING so SREC prints out a lot of information to stdout. This is normally not defined to avoid clutter. These can be added by editing the following files under the SREC source tree:

	make\asr\Makefile.common for Q Device

Beta3: revision 758
*********************************************************************************************************


Bugfixes
--------

- Hang due to increment of jvmReferences even if there was a scheduled task pending
- Hang during process shutdown (threads killed in an unpredictable order)
- JVMKeepAlive would sometimes create a new thread before the old thread died.  This caused the new thread to never start.
- Possible crash on non-numeric or 0 confidence score
- Javadoc corrections

Java New Features
-----------------


C++ API changes
---------------

* Reorganized C++ layer code (moved cpp/common to cpp/utilities, etc).


Java API changes
----------------

* AudioStream was reporting AUDIO_ALREADY_IN_USE if the stream was empty. It now reports END_OF_STREAM.

* Changed package name from com.nuance.uapi to android.speech.recognition




*********************************************************************************************************
Beta3.1: revision 761
*********************************************************************************************************


Same as Beta 3 but with consolidated shared libraries for Q platform (everything in libUAPI_jni.so).
This primarily involved SREC and UAPI makefile changes (what used to be .so is now .a, except for
final libUAPI_jni.so).  There was a change in EmbeddedRecognizer.cpp so libUAPI_api.so is no longer
dynamically loaded, and relevant functions are just called directly.  For Windows and Ubuntu builds
the symbol RECOGNIZER_DYNAMICALLY_LOADED had to be defined.


*********************************************************************************************************
Beta3.2: revision 819
*********************************************************************************************************


General stability improvements
Still has local reference table overflow issue
Java test program reorganization
Java, C++ and C test programs need to explicitly built
renamed /system/usr/srec.config/ to /system/usr/srec/config/


*********************************************************************************************************
Beta4.0: revision 882

- Fixed local reference table overflow
- Fixed crash on 2nd Recognizer.configure() call
- Fixed crash on calling Recognizer.stop()
- Fixed Microphone race condition
- Replaced inefficient logger introduced in Beta 3.2
- Disabled JNIKeepAlive for improved efficiency.  Console apps must now keep main thread alive to prevent the JVM from shutting down
- SpeechRecorder no longer crashes
- Implemented Recognizer getParam()/setParam() and provided sample Java app Parameters.java
- Robustness1 ran for over 2 days (250,000+ iterations) before it was stopped.
- New Robustness2 application for microphone + recognizer testing
- Reduced compiler warnings
- Updated SpeakContact example to compile with 11/08 Android SDK snapshot


*********************************************************************************************************
Beta5.0: revision 939
*********************************************************************************************************

- Speed and stability improvements
- Includes open-source grammar compiler (extlibs/srec/tools/grxmlcompile) for Ubuntu 6.06 Linux.  The SpeechWorks grammar compiler is no longer supported.
- New Robustness3 application for more thorough exercise of API
- Includes Voicetags support
- New Voicetags1 application to exercise voicetags
- New API function to add a list of items to a slot (see addItemList method)
- Added a work around for audio driver bug: unable to set input format immediately after closing the driver since DMA is still active, according to HTC.  See ANDROID_AUDIODRIVER_WORKAROUND in device/extlibs/srec/uapi/cpp/audio/linux/source/MicrophoneLINUX.cpp and device/extlibs/srec/uapi/make/uapi/Makefile.common


*********************************************************************************************************
RC-1: revision 1040
*********************************************************************************************************

- Speed and stability improvements
- Includes open-source grammar compiler (extlibs/srec/tools/grxmlcompile) for Ubuntu 6.06 Linux.  The SpeechWorks grammar compiler is no longer supported.  This grammar compiler no longer needs cppdom binaries.  Instead, tinyxml is used.
- Faster grammar compilation
- New models (cross-word triphones)
 -Voicetags end of speed detection fix
- Added getAPIversion() to hidden System class (see limitations below)
- Faster audio input processing

*********************************************************************************************************
Beta7.0: revision 1071
*********************************************************************************************************

- SREC and UAPI now use Android logger on device
- Delay loading of SREC user dictionary until it is needed
- Merged Mike Glover’s optimized dictionary load code
- Added # prefix to *.ok language header (#LANG=EN-US)
- Reduced compiler warnings for third-party library OpenFst
- Reduced /system/usr/srec footprint from 12 MB to 1.9 MB. Now one must “make srec_test_files” to install optional test files.
- More complete checking of dictionary for non-lower-case words
- Speed improvement: compute log tables offline (log_tabl.c, log_add.c)
- Fix: Crash when null string: SrecGrammar.Item(WordItem, 1, (String)null)
- Fix: Crash when null AudioStream passed to EmbeddedRecognizer.recognize
- Fix: Crash on long list passed to addItemList(). Local references were previously leaked.
- Fix: Mispronunciation when there are special characters or two embedded blanks in a name passed to WordItem
- Fix: Pronunciation involving unprintable characters
- Fix: Pronunciation for “oh”, now should get fewer insertions
- Fix: Homonym collision problem. No longer abort processing.
